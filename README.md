# Besticlopedia

**Besticlopedia** is a study project to catalog and display animals directly in the terminal, built with **Go (Golang)**.
This project was born from a passion for **biology** and **Go programming**. The goal is to create a simple application that allows you to:

- List animals with basic information
- Show details of each species in the terminal
- Learn good Go programming practices
