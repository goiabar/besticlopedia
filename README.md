# 📘 Besticlopedia

**Besticlopedia** is an open-source project written in **Go (Golang)** that combines programming and biology into a terminal-based animal encyclopedia.

This project was created as a way to learn Golang while exploring my passion for **biology**. Besticlopedia allows users to **catalog animals**, organize them into **categories**, and display important information about each species in a clear and structured way.

All interaction happens directly in the **terminal**, providing a simple, fast, and focused CLI experience — ideal for developers who enjoy command-line tools or want to practice data organization, structs, and general application design in Go.

Besticlopedia is designed to be **flexible and extensible**. Anyone can use it to catalog their own animals or adapt it to organize other types of living beings or collections.
